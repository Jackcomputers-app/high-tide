High Tide Aviation is excited to share a major milestone in our journey to train the next generation of pilots. We have officially earned our Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 141 certification â€” a designation that marks a new chapter in providing structured, high-quality flight training to students in coastal North Carolina, Georgia, and beyond.

## What Part 141 Certification Means

FAA Part 141 certification is recognized across the aviation industry for its rigorous standards and efficiency. Unlike the traditional Part 61 training pathway, Part 141 programs follow an FAA-approved syllabus designed to streamline training while maintaining the highest standards of safety and professionalism.

For students, this means significant benefits:  

- **Private Pilot License (PPL):** Minimum flight hours reduced from 40 under Part 61 to 35 under Part 141.  
- **Commercial Pilot License (CPL):** Minimum hours reduced from 250 to 190, saving both time and cost.  
- **International Students:** With Part 141 approval, High Tide Aviation is now able to accept M-1 visa students, welcoming aspiring pilots from around the world.  

## Why This Matters for Students

Part 141 training provides a structured, efficient pathway that appeals especially to those pursuing aviation as a career. The reduced hour requirements donâ€™t just represent savings â€” they also reflect a more focused and accelerated approach to reaching advanced ratings. This allows students to move from private pilot to commercial pilot more quickly, while still meeting all FAA requirements.

International students will also find new opportunities at High Tide Aviation. With M-1 visa eligibility, pilots from across the globe can now come to Southport, Wilmington, and St. Simons Island to train with our experienced instructors in a scenic and dynamic environment.

## Training With High Tide Aviation

Operating out of **Southport, NC; Wilmington, NC; and St. Simons Island, GA**, High Tide Aviation offers both flight training and scenic tours, giving students access to a diverse fleet of aircraft and a professional team of instructors. Our locations are known for their stunning coastal views and dynamic airspace, providing an ideal environment for training.

This certification is more than a credential â€” it validates the dedication of our staff and strengthens our ability to help students reach their goals. Whether you are local to the Carolinas or traveling internationally to pursue an aviation career, our Part 141 programs offer a pathway to success.
