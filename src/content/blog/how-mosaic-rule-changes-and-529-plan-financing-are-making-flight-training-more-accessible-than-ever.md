## What Is the FAA's MOSAIC Initiative?

MOSAIC stands for **Modernization of Special Airworthiness Certification**. This long-anticipated FAA rulemaking initiative was designed to _expand the capabilities and privileges of Light Sport Aircraft (LSAs)_ and the pilots who fly them. Under the new rules, which are expected to go into effect soon:

- The **weight and performance limitations** for LSAs will be significantly increased.
- Sport pilots may be allowed to fly aircraft with **up to four seats**.
- Certain commercial and advanced training operations may become accessible to pilots with **Sport Pilot certificates**.

### Why This Matters

For student pilots, MOSAIC could mean:

- **Faster access** to larger and more capable training aircraft.
- **Lower training costs** through the use of modern LSAs with lower operating expenses.
- An accelerated pathway from your first lesson to more advanced ratings and potential career options.

## Use Your 529 Plan to Fund Flight Training

Another game-changing update is the ability to use **529 College Savings Plans** to help finance flight training. Traditionally reserved for accredited colleges and universities, 529 plans can now be applied to **vocational and career-oriented training**—including many FAA-approved flight schools.

### What Can You Pay for with a 529?

If you enroll in an **eligible flight training program**, you may be able to use your 529 savings to cover:

- Private Pilot License (PPL) training
- Instrument Rating
- Commercial Pilot License (CPL)
- Certified Flight Instructor (CFI/CFII) programs

At High Tide Aviation, we offer structured, professional programs across all these levels, with training available in both airplanes and helicopters.
