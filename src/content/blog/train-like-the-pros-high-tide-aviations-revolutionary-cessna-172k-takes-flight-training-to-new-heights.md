The aviation industry is evolving rapidly, and so should your training. At **High Tide Aviation**, we believe future pilots deserve to learn on the same cutting-edge technology they'll use throughout their careers. That's why we've completely transformed our **Cessna 172K N79475** into a state-of-the-art Technically Advanced Airplane (TAA) that rivals aircraft costing ten times more.

Available at our Southport, Wilmington, and St. Simons Island locations, this isn't just another trainer—it's your gateway to professional aviation.

## From Analog to Amazing: A Complete Cockpit Revolution

Gone are the days of squinting at steam gauges and analog dials. **N79475** now features a professional-grade Garmin glass cockpit that would make airline pilots jealous:

### **Garmin G3X Touch: Your Command Center**

Imagine having all your flight information displayed on a crystal-clear, 10.6-inch touchscreen. The G3X Touch seamlessly integrates your primary flight display (PFD) and multi-function display (MFD), giving you:

- Synthetic vision technology that "sees" through clouds and darkness
- Real-time engine monitoring with predictive alerts
- Integrated flight planning and weather overlay
- Terrain awareness and obstacle warnings

### **Garmin G5: Your Safety Net**

Even the most advanced systems need backup. The compact G5 attitude indicator provides independent pitch and bank information, ensuring you're never without critical flight data—a feature that could save your life in challenging conditions.

### **GTN 650: Navigation Perfection**

This isn't your grandfather's GPS. The GTN 650 combines:

- IFR-certified GPS navigation with worldwide database
- Dual-frequency communications
- Real-time weather radar overlay
- Approach capability for all precision and non-precision procedures

### **GTX 345 Transponder: See and Be Seen**

With ADS-B In and Out capability, you'll receive the same traffic and weather information that commercial pilots rely on. Watch other aircraft appear on your display in real-time, and receive weather updates that help you make smarter decisions.

### **GFC 500 Autopilot: Fly Like a Pro**

This isn't a basic wing-leveler. The GFC 500 offers:

- Precise altitude and heading hold
- GPS navigation tracking
- Approach coupling for instrument procedures
- Envelope protection features

## Why This Matters for Your Aviation Career
