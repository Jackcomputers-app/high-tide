If you have ever dreamed of becoming a pilot, one of the first questions that likely comes to mind is, **"How long does it take to learn to fly?"**

At **High Tide Aviation**, we offer professional flight instruction in **Southport, Wilmington, and Wallace, North Carolina**, as well as **St. Simons Island, Georgia**.

## The Basics of Private Pilot Training

Most new pilots begin their journey with the **Private Pilot Certificate**, which allows you to fly for personal and recreational purposes. The [Federal Aviation Administration](https://www.faa.gov/faq/what-are-hourly-requirements-becoming-pilot#:~:text=A%20person%20applying%20for%20a,three%20hours%20of%20cross%20country%3B) requires a **minimum of 40 flight hours** to qualify, but the national average is closer to **60 to 70 hours** before a student is ready for the final checkride.

These hours include flight lessons with an instructor, solo practice flights, cross-country flights, and preparation for both the written and practical exams. Learning to fly is about much more than just handling the controls. It also involves understanding weather, airspace, communication, and making safe decisions in a wide variety of scenarios.

## Part-Time and Full-Time Flight Training

How long it takes to become a pilot largely depends on how often you can train.

### Training a Few Times a Week

If you fly once or twice a week, the journey to your private pilot certificate typically takes **six to twelve months**. This part-time approach works well for students who are managing work, school, or family responsibilities. It is also ideal for those who prefer to move at a steady pace and absorb information gradually.

### Training More Frequently

If you have the flexibility to fly **three to five times a week**, your training can move much faster. Many full-time students are able to complete their certification in as little as **two to three months**. This is a great option for those who are focused on career goals or want to get licensed quickly.

At High Tide Aviation, we tailor [training programs](/flight-training/ground-school) to fit your availability and learning preferences. Whether you are flying from **coastal North Carolina** or **southern Georgia**, we are here to support your journey.

## Other Factors That Affect Your Timeline

There are a few other elements that can influence how quickly you progress:

- **Weather conditions** can affect your ability to fly regularly. Fortunately, our locations in **Southport**, **St. Simons Island**, and surrounding areas offer generally favorable weather for flying throughout the year.
- **Aircraft and instructor availability** are important too. High Tide Aviation has a well maintained fleet and a team of certified flight instructors at each location to keep your training on track.
- **Student preparation** plays a big role. Studying between lessons and staying engaged with your ground school can help reduce the total number of hours you need.

## Ground School and the Written Test

Alongside your flight training, you will complete ground school to prepare for the FAA knowledge exam. This portion covers key topics such as regulations, aerodynamics, weather theory, and navigation. Students often finish ground school in **four to eight weeks**, and it can be completed online or through guided instruction.

Many students choose to complete ground school while flight training is underway, which keeps everything moving forward efficiently.
