**Flight Training Now Available at Wallace-Penderton Airport (KACZ)**

High Tide Aviation is excited to announce the expansion of its flight training operations with a new location at **Wallace-Penderton Airport (KACZ)** in Wallace, North Carolina. This new location was opened to meet the increasing demand for professional flight training, especially from military personnel and civilian pilots in the surrounding communities.

### Why High Tide Aviation Expanded to Wallace
High Tide Aviation’s move into Wallace is part of our strategy to bring high-quality flight training to underserved areas. The Wallace location will serve aspiring pilots from **Burgaw, Jacksonville, Wilmington, Clinton**, and other nearby municipalities that have historically lacked access to professional aviation training. Now, residents of these towns no longer need to travel long distances for flight instruction.

Additionally, this new location will cater to the flight training needs of military personnel stationed at **Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, Marine Corps Air Station New River**, and **Seymour Johnson Air Force Base**. Many service members and veterans are interested in flight training, whether to enhance their aviation skills or transition into civilian aviation careers. High Tide Aviation’s programs offer flexible scheduling options to meet the demands of military personnel, allowing them to pursue their **Private Pilot License (PPL)** and **Instrument Rating (IR)** certifications.

### What the Wallace Location Offers
The Wallace-Penderton Airport location will provide fixed-wing training using the **Cessna 172 Skyhawk**, one of the most trusted and reliable training aircraft in aviation. Students at Wallace can pursue both their **Private Pilot License (PPL)** and **Instrument Rating (IR)** certifications. Our flight programs meet all FAA standards, ensuring students receive thorough training that equips them to fly single-engine aircraft safely.

### Communities and Military Personnel Served
The new High Tide Aviation location in Wallace will benefit nearby towns such as **Teachey, Rose Hill, and Burgaw**, in addition to serving the broader Wilmington and Jacksonville areas. For local residents, this new facility provides a convenient, professional option for aviation training without long commutes.

Furthermore, **military personnel** stationed at nearby bases—**Camp Lejeune**, **MCAS New River**, and **Seymour Johnson AFB**—can take advantage of our flight training programs. Our training schedule is adaptable to military commitments, ensuring that service members can pursue flight certification at their own pace, without interrupting their professional duties.

### High Standards in Flight Training
High Tide Aviation has built a reputation for its commitment to safety, high-quality instruction, and well-maintained aircraft. Our **Cessna 172 Skyhawks** are widely recognized for their stability and ease of handling, making them ideal for new and intermediate pilots. The Wallace location will maintain the same rigorous training standards that our students have come to expect.

### Expansion to Meet Growing Demand
This new location in Wallace is part of High Tide Aviation’s continued expansion throughout the Southeastern United States. With the success of our flagship location at **Cape Fear Regional Jetport (KSUT)** in Southport, NC, and our second location at **McKinnon-St. Simons Airport (KSSI)** in St. Simons Island, GA, High Tide Aviation is well-positioned to bring our proven training methods to a wider audience.

### About High Tide Aviation
High Tide Aviation, originally founded as High Tide Helicopters at **Cape Fear Regional Jetport (KSUT)** in Southport, NC, specializes in both **fixed-wing** and **rotary-wing flight training**. We offer a wide range of programs, from **Private Pilot License** to **Multi-Engine Instructor** certifications. Our dedicated team of flight instructors and commitment to safety have made High Tide Aviation a trusted name in the aviation community.

With the addition of our new location in Wallace, High Tide Aviation continues to expand to better serve the flight training needs of North Carolina’s growing aviation community, including civilian pilots and military personnel.
