          The High Tide Story
        </h3>
        <p class="text-gray-500 leading-relaxed mt-3 mb-2">
          High Tide Aviation began in 2013 as High Tide Helicopters with just
          one Robinson R22. Quickly expanding to include airplanes, the school
          rebranded and now operates 12 aircraft at locations in Southport, NC,
          and St Simons Island, GA. As the top flight school in Southeastern
          North Carolina and Southeastern Georgia, High Tide offers training for
          commercial licenses and instrument ratings, using ASA publications and
          maintaining a pilot shop.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-500 leading-relaxed mb-5">
          The company emphasizes community involvement and education, partnering
          with local colleges to teach aviation courses and engaging with local
          youth about aviation careers. High Tide ensures personalized support
          for each student through dedicated specialists, focusing on safety,
          professionalism, and inclusivity. Aspiring pilots are invited to
          explore the coastlines and learn at a leading school known for quality
          training and community commitment.

          As such a specialized skill, flight training can be confusing on even
          its best day. We understand that each student comes to us with
          different learning preferences and a diverse range of experiences. To
          better support our students, we have an in-house Student Support
          Department and assign a specific support specialist to every High Tide
          student in Southport and St Simons Island.
