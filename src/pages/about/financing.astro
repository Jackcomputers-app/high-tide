          Partnered Financing
        </h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          We have established partnerships with top educational funding
          companies to assist prospective pilots in achieving their aviation
          goals. Through our collaboration with Meratas, we offer the Meratas
          Lender Marketplace, which provides personalized loan offers from
          multiple lenders. This platform allows you to obtain instant
          pre-qualification for loans, which can cover both your educational and
          living expenses during trainingâ€”without impacting your credit score.

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Beyond traditional loans, there are numerous scholarships and grants
          available to aspiring pilots. High Tide Aviation helps you identify
          and apply for these funds, which can significantly reduce the overall
          cost of your flight training. Organizations like the Aircraft Owners
          and Pilots Association (AOPA) and the Experimental Aircraft
          Association (EAA) offer financial aid programs specifically designed
          for aviation students.
