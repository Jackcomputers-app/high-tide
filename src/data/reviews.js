      "Life is too short to fly commercial and be treated like dirt. Fly High Tide Aviation and set your own schedule. Be treated like an appreciated customer flown by folks who love what they do. When it works, it works.",

    review:
      "I took my daughter on a helicopter Discovery Flight. We both loved it. She flew the helicopter using all 3 controls. If we lived nearby, she would definitely take helicopter flight training from High Tide Aviation. Willis was a great instructor and encouragement to her! Now, I want to do it!",
